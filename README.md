## scRNA-seq_shiny_app_dashboard

This is a generic app that can be used for visualizing single-cell RNA-seq data. This app uses data stored as Seurat objects in a .RDS file. The demo app can be found at Demo: https://gladstone-bioinformatics.shinyapps.io/scrna-seq-dashboard-demo/. 

Below are some recommendations to customize this app for another dataset.

1. Place the data (.RDS file) in the "data" folder in the same directory as the global.R, ui.R and server.R.
2. Modify the scripts:  
    global.R 
      - update the dataset to be used in the app
      - update the value of the variable "plot_download_prefix"

    ui.R
      - Change application title
      - Change the dataset choices based on the datasets to be used in the app
      
    server.R
      - update the plots and metadata used in the plots
